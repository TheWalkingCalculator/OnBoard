# MultiplexerBoardForSensors

This board is just one part of a bigger project that I am working on for a farm club at my shool. The goal of the project is to have sensors in the soil that read the mosture content. This board spacififcaly is used to make the microcontroler have the ability to have more sensors connected than the pins it has.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $3.10 to make it not have lead, since it will be around kids.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
